### Paper Contribultions / Implementations:

1. We introduce the Model-Based Diffusion (MBD) framework for trajectory optimization, utilizing the dynamics model to estimate the score function. This enables an effective trajectory planner given non-smooth dynamics and non-convex objectives, such as contact-rich manipulation tasks or
high-dimensional humanoids.
2. Our analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate that MBD matches, and often exceeds, the performance of existing reinforcement learning and sampling-based TO methods. In particular, MBD outperforms PPO by 59% in various tasks within tens of seconds of diffusing.
3. We demonstrate MBDâ€™s flexibility in utilizing diverse imperfect data to steer the diffusion process and further enhance the performance. Specifically, the resulting whole-body humanoid trajectory from MBD is more natural by utilizing the lower-body-state-only human motion data. Similarly,
MBD can effectively address long-horizon sparse-reward Umaze navigation tasks by leveraging infeasible demonstrations generated by an RRT planner with simplified dynamics.
